##Personal commentary.##  

On Friday, September 2nd I took an amtrak train the Lacy/Olympia station from Portland.  Kaiao picked me up at about 8:30 PM and we went to his apartment in Dupont Washington. Kaiao’s wife Amanda gave me an air mattress, some sheets to sleep on and she made beef stew for us. We spent some time resituating our gear for departure early the next morning. We departed at 5 AM, drove two hours to Rainier national Park and arrived at 7:20 AM to pick up our permits. The weather on Saturday, September 3 was perfect for climbing, we could see the top half of Rainier very clearly on the drive. We spotted many deer on the way including a few fawns as we took a route that bisects a military base. We arrived at Paradise climbing office to obtain our permits which cost $46 apiece. Then we proceeded to make the final adjustments on our packs. We hit the trail by 8:20 AM. The first 2.5 miles were maintained trail and pavement. 

Kaiao had some issues with the altitude at about 8000 ft. The last 1000 feet of the vertical gain on the hike were extremely beautiful, we witnessed massive landslides on the south face of Mount Rainier. The accent took about five hours and we arrived just after 1 PM. When we got to the top of the Muir snowfield we took our packs off slept for about 30 minutes at the overlook platform. At about 3 PM the guided groups arrived. The Muir camping area was empty except for two tents and we proceeded to clear a spot with our ice axes in order to set up the tent. It took about two hours to set up camp. We burned water and hydrated our dinner at 5:30 PM and at about 6:30 PM the Ranger began checking permits for everyone in camp. He checked our permit and we asked questions about the route. He made a recommendation that we carry Picketts. Our original plan was to start climbing Cathedral gap at 11PM however, the fact that we did not have adequate protection readily available without sacrificing our ice axes for snow anchors caused me to rethink that decision and leave after the majority of the guided groups in order to ensure that we can follow their boot pack because the climbing route had received a significant amount of snow in the previous days. The ranger had mentioned that there had been multiple unsuccessful attempts to summit during the passed seven days because the Ingraham section was covered in thigh deep snow.  

I set my alarm for 12:30 AM and didn't wake up until 12:39 AM. Conditions were ideal, there was zero wind and the temp was about 25F. We saw the majority of the groups leaving shortly after we then proceeded to rack our gear and rig prussics. This process Took about 45 minutes which pushed our start time to about 2:45 AM. I suggested we use powdered soylent to eat so we wouldn’t need to heat water. Kaiao had a much easier time climbing because the five hours of sleep at 10,000 ft. let his body acclimate. However, his hard shell boots were again causing pain. I recommended that he transition to regular boots plus crampons. We proceeded through the ice fall at Ingraham glacier and we came to a crevasse crossing that was about 4.5 feet wide and the immediate edge was drastically overhung. There was no alternate route available. The gap was a no fall zone and the ledge we had to step off of was overhung at a precarious angle. There was a fixed anchor in which Kaiao clipped and I made the delicate jump across the gap. When I was on the other side of the gap I looked for places to clip into I couldn’t find anything sufficient to protect Kaiao as he made the crossing. So, I crossed back over, this time using the fixed rope as an assist and we decided to turn around because this crevasse crossing was extremely dangerous and we didn't feel comfortable making multiple crossings without adequate protection. We turned around just before the disappointment cleaver base at about 11,500 feet and proceeded to descend back to camp Muir. Once we arrived, we proceeded to disassemble the rope configuration and organize gear in order to break camp. We slept for about 30 minutes until 7:30 AM and at that point started to cook breakfast. We broke camp and descended to Paradise. 
We talked to the ranger and asked advice on how to safely cross the crevasse. The proper technique is to have your partner to back up and take all of the slack out of the rope and brace for a fall with ice axe engaged. That way, the distance of a fall is minimized. This technique works best with three or more in a rope team. Two man roped travel is for experts only as executing an extraction is extremely difficult if the person has to hold a full load while creating a suitable anchor.  
We arrived at Paradise at about 12:40 PM and he drove two hours back to Dupont Washington. 

##Things to do different next attempt:##  
*Bring picketts, one per person. 
*Cut cordellette and rig prussic knots beforehand.
*Using slings as prussics was sloppy and cumbersome
*Make sure to have a three man rope team
*Bring a longer rope. 50m instead of 33 m. 
*Start later, ascent to Muir will only take 4 hours.
