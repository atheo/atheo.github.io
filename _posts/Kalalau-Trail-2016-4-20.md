title: Kalalau Trail Hike
---


Monday morning (04/18) we went to lay Petit Caf√© for breakfast with the intent to watch the website for updates on whether the Kalalau trail was going to open it had been closed for the previous three days because of flash flood danger.
It finally opened at around 11 AM on Monday morning so we packed up our stuff at the condo closed it out and went to the trailhead when we got to the trailhead we were took us about 30 minutes to load all of the stuff that we needed for the hike and just is about time as we are starting to head up to the trailhead I ran into Nguyen arts the avalanche one instructor for The Mazama is not nearing group.
He and his wife were planning to hike the Kalalau trail on Wednesday and the same week it was very nice to see them and chat about the trail and about previous hikes that they have done during their stay.
Casey and I finally started hiking at about 11:30 AM on Monday morning we started with two or three other hikers with large backpack and we proceeded to make really good time.  
The first Rivercrossing was slow and it seem to be very crowded but as we kept hiking the trail got more and more sparse.
It kind of seemed like the couples that we start hiking with really wanted to make it to mile six to the first camp and they wanted to make sure that there was a campsite available I don't think anybody knew what to expect but everybody we saw was very friendly and we even made friends with the couple that was directly ahead of us.
Casey and I rolled into camp six at the 6 mile mark at about 4 PM we had passed all the other couples except for one and a single hacker that look like he was really fast.  
We didn't see anybody else that we passed on the trail three assumed that they all camped at mile six.
Casey and I were fine with hiking into the dark because we knew exactly where we needed to go we knew that the campsites would be open because the trail was closed for the previous three days.
After mile six the trail becomes increasingly exposed you are right up next to the ocean and a very very steep grade.
The swells were enormous we would see sets of 15 foot waves barrel into the side of the rocks and at about mile 9 mile started not taking off so fast and fatigue is setting in.  
At about 9 1/2 there is a notorious section called crawlers ledge which is deemed the most dangerous section of the trail the reason for the danger is the exposure to a steep cliff and at the very end of crawlers ledge there's a class five scramble.
This section had Casey extremely worried she was fatigued and it was getting dark in the wind was blowing extremely hard but we cruise through the section and made it to Redhill just of the sun was going down we ran into a small herd of goats which got a little freaked out and ran away from us but is very cool to see them on the trail there was absolutely no other people around us and we hadn't seen anybody for an hour or two.  We did run into one girl in a sundress and sneakers that was hiking at least twice as fast as both of Casey and I at about mile 8 1/2 Sheese said hi and passed us and was gone and we didn't see her until the following day. We rolled into the campsite at about 8 PM we were both out of water so we had to fill up in the stream that borders the campsites and then go pick our site.  
We found a suitable spot set up our tent and quickly laid down after blowing up our air mattresses and setting up our sleeping bags. We were both exhausted too exhausted to even boil water for dinner. After setting up our camp we walked towards the end of the campsites to look for the waterfall confused as the shower. The waterfall has a small pool at its base and their soap left by people on the rocks we washed off our feet and legs and have a quick hobo shower in the waterfall it felt really nice it's very secluded and we felt really comfortable getting clean in the moonlight. At about 9:30 PM we quickly boiled some water poured it into our Mountainhouse meals had a few bites then went to bed. The next morning we woke up at about 7:30 AM the sun was up the swells we're hitting the beach right next to our camp and we decided to go for a little walk. There was some old naked guy on the beach going for a swim and doing yoga, he was our neighbor.  
We decided that we wanted to go find the swimming pools so we made some water for our breakfast and then we set off to go find the swimming pools. We hiked for about 3 miles and we were passed by a group of very nice singing forest travelers. There was two females both topless and everyone was barefoot and they were traveling out running speed one of the girls was singing you are my sunshine they all said hi and gave Kc a complement as they passed and quickly disappeared. After finding the first pool we had a quick dip then put her clothes back on and kept walking up the valley upstream. 
We found a large swimming pool at the base of a small fall there was a rope swing and a large boulder to jump off of it was still very rainy weather and slightly cold but Kc and I both went for a swim in the large pool and I had a chance to jump off and try out the pro please. Hiking up to the large Flamepool very interesting there was a large jungle plan Funnycide we had to avoid getting trapped in spiderwebs and there was lots of interesting little newts and bugs all around this is also where the mosquitoes. Seem to hang out.  
After coming back down from the swimming pools a guy came out from behind us at running speed introduced himself and asked us if we wanted to go to the gardens we said yes so he started following him we had to run to keep up with them but hey we were chatting and he said he was from North Carolina name was Finn and. And that it was fine if we wanted to take a walk around the Gardens he took us off the main trail to a large area full of taro root terraces papaya trees wine cheese banana trees and plants of all sorts it was very beautiful there was also memorial to what looked like it was a person that found the place. Everyone we signed the garden was about age 20 or 30 in their 20s or 30s. To our camp we filled up our water bladders in the stream in order to have enough water for dinner that night we got back to camp and spend some well needed time in the Hamic then we decided to go walk to the end of the beach over to the hidden sea cave.  
When I got back to camp after that we made some dinner and then proceeded to get everything ready for departure in the morning. The next morning we woke up and quickly broke down our camp and were on the trail by 8:30 AM. Hiking back out we got to see the whole trail has all of the features that we missed on the way in became apparent. We saw another sea cave as well as an arch that we missed on the way and we also walked by part of the cliffs where a rainbow had formed we could see the entire thing. We felt really confident on the way out because we were making great time we had an early start and we hit the 6 mile camp at about 11 AM this is also the time where we ran into Nguyen our friend and his wife Anna Maria. As they were hitting their 6 miles in point they had previously given me guff about my foot where choice of Choco's but I had zero issues with my footwear and it look like they were hiking with wet trail shoes because of all of the stream crossings. I wouldn't be surprised if the next time I hike with Nguyen on a wet hike he's got Chaco's instead of trail shoes. As we started the second half on the hike out fatigue started to set in a little earlier and it started to rain again so Casey started getting wigged out about flash letting danger on the last Rivercrossing bike out was also at least twice his body has the hike and I think because it had the rain had finally seeped in and stuck stuck to the trail a little more so every single Valley that we had to hike up-and-down was a mud bog.   By the time we got to the last stream crossing at the 2 mile mark Casey was ready to be done it was perfectly fine to cross and she didn't even change her foot where she just crossed into hiking boots and we are ready to get out of there the last 2 mile seem to take the longest and seem to be the muddiest. I pulled out way had of Casey during the last 2 miles and I finished the hike and ran down to the parking lot to get her vehicle so I could run up to meet Casey will she finished she came out of the trail and I saw her she was looking at the beach that's at the base of the trail over the sunny sky. We then went over to the sand shower next to the restrooms and washed the mud off of our legs and feet and then headed to the picnic table on the beach Tete some chips and drink a beer. It was extremely satisfying to be done with the hike and sitting in the sunshine. We decided that we needed to get going because we had to drive about an hour and a half to the south side of the island and check into a new condo which was at the Kuhio shores on the southside in poipu. The new condo was very nice of is right next to the ocean next to a restaurant called the Beachhouse. The lanai was about 25 feet from a perfect snorkeling spot. After we got settled into the new condo we were still exhausted from the hike so we decided to just lounge inside that night we watched Jurassic Park and then some other crappy movie on some other crappy channel but it was perfect because we're both extremely exhausted. The next day was our do-nothing day we went and found some breakfast somewhere and then found a nice beach extra resort and set up the Hamic and just sat on the beach. I went out snorkeling and spotted a nice size white and black you'll as well as my first taco found a taco underneath the rock and tried to get him to come out but he wouldn't. After getting done snorkeling at the beach we went to a place called Keoki's paradise and got a mai tai and some food I had fish tacos that were excellent and then we went back to the condo.   
The next day we decided to go for a hike out near Waimea Canyon and overlook Kalalau beach where we had stayed earlier in the week. This was a one and a half mile hike to the viewpoint which was equally as steep and muddy as anything we saw on Kalalau trail it was not a fun hike. But it was interesting to see the view point directly above the beach where he had previously slept. That night we had dinner at the beach house which was extremely expensive however it was right on the sunset feeling point and we caught a nice sunset and it was a nice dinner. The next day we hat we checked into our flight and headed home.
