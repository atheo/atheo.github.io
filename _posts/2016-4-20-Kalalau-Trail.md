### Hiking the Napali Coast Line

Monday morning (04/18) we went to the Petit Café for breakfast with the intent to watch public website on our phones for updates on whether the Kalalau trail was going to open. It had been closed for the previous three days because of flash flood danger.
It finally opened at around 11 AM so we packed up our stuff at the airbnb and went to the trailhead. When we got there, we started our pre hike gear shuffle as we started to walk up to the trailhead I ran into Wim Arts, the Avy 101 instructor for the Mazamas avalance saftey course I took a few weeks earlier.
He and his wife were planning to hike the Kalalau trail later that week on Wednesday. It very nice to see them and chat about the trail and about previous hikes that they have done during their stay.
Casey and I finally started hiking at about 11:30 AM on Monday morning we started with two or three other hikers with large backpacks and we proceeded to make really good time. 
The first river crossing was slow and crowded but as we kept hiking the crowd got more and more sparse.
It kind of seemed like the couples that we started hiking with really wanted to make it to mile six to the first camp and they wanted to make sure that there was a campsite available .I don't think anybody knew what to expect but everyone we saw was very friendly and we even made friends with the couple that was directly ahead of us.
Casey and I rolled into camp six at the 6 mile mark at about 4 PM we had passed all the other couples except for one and a single hiker that was really fast.  
We were fine with hiking into darkness because we knew exactly where we needed to go we knew that the campsites would be open because the trail was closed for the previous three days.
After mile six the trail becomes increasingly exposed you are right up next to the ocean and a very very steep grade.
The swells were enormous we would see sets of 15 foot waves barrel into the side of the rocks and at about mile 9 fatigue was taking hold.  
At about 9.5 miles, there is a notorious section named "Crawlers Ledge" which is deemed the most dangerous section of the trail. The reason for the danger is that it's highly exposed to a steep cliff and at the very end of the line there is a small class five scramble.
This section had Casey extremely worried. She was fatigued, it was dark, the wind was blowing, but we cruised through the section and made it to Redhill just after the sun was going down. We ran into a small herd of goats which got a little freaked out and ran away from us but it was very cool to see them on the trail. 
There was absolutely no other people around us and we hadn't seen a soul for an hour or two.  We did run into one girl in a sundress and sneakers that was hiking at least twice as fast as both of Casey and I at about mile 8.5. She said hi and passed us and we didn't see her until the following day. We rolled into the campsite at about 8 PM we were both out of water so we had to fill up in the stream that borders the campsites and then go find a site.  
We found a suitable spot, set up our tent and quickly laid down after blowing up our air mattresses and unpacking our sleeping bags. After setting up our camp we walked towards the end of the campsites in search of the communal shower. It's a waterfall that has a small pool at its base. We washed off our feet and legs and had a quick hobo shower in the waterfall it felt really nice. It's very secluded and we felt really comfortable getting clean in the moonlight. At about 9:30 PM we quickly boiled some water poured it into our Mountainhouse meals had a few bites then went to bed. The next morning we woke up at about 7:30 AM the sun was up the swells we're hitting the beach right next to our camp and we decided to go for a little walk. There was some old naked guy on the beach going for a swim and doing yoga, he was our neighbor.  
We decided that we wanted to go find the swimming pools so we heated some water for breakfast and then we set off to go find the swimming pools. We hiked for about 3 miles and we were passed by a group of singing forest dwellers. There was two ladies and two guys, everyone was barefoot and they were moving at about running speed. 
One of the girls was singing "you are my sunshine" and they all said hi and gave Casey a complement as they passed and quickly disappeared. After finding the first pool, we had a quick swim then put our clothes back on and kept walking upstream. We came upon a large swimming pool at the base of a small fall there was a rope swing and a large boulder to jump off of. It was stil rainy and slightly cold but Casey and I both went for a swim in the large pool and I had a chance to jump off and try out the rope swing. The hike up to the pool was very interesting, there was foliage so thick it created a tunnel around the trail. We had to avoid spiderwebs and there was lots of interesting little newts and bugs all around this is also where the mosquitoes seemed to be the most numerous.   
After coming down from the pools, a guy came up from behind us at running speed. He introduced himself and asked us if we wanted to go to the gardens. We said yes and started following him. We ran at a chatting pace to keep up; he said he was from North Carolina and that his name was Finn. He took us off the main trail to a large area full of taro root terraces papaya trees, lime and bananna trees and plants of all sorts. It was a very beautiful garden. There was also memorial to the woman founded the place. Everyone we saw in the garden was in their 20s or 30s. 
Shortly after, we cruised back to our camp and filled up our water bladders in the stream so as to have enough water for dinner that night. Then spent some much needed time in the hammock. After, we decided to go walk to the end of the beach over to a hidden sea cave.  
After dinner we proceeded to get everything ready for departure in the morning. The next morning we woke up and quickly broke down our camp and were on the trail by 8:30 AM. Hiking back out we got to see the whole trail has all of the features that we missed on the way in became apparent. We saw another sea cave as well as an arch that we missed on the way in and we also walked by part of the cliffs where a rainbow had formed we could see the entire phenomenon, end to end. We felt really confident on the way out because we were making great time we had an early start and we hit the 6 mile camp at about 11 AM. This is also the time where we ran into Wim our friend and his wife Anna Maria as they were hitting their 6 mile point. At the trail head, Wim had chided me about my footwear choice (Chaco 2z) but I had zero issues with my footwear and it looked like they were hiking with wet trail shoes because of all of the stream crossings. I wouldn't be surprised if the next time I hike with Wim on a wet hike that he's got Chacos instead of trail shoes. 
As we started the second half on the hike out, fatigue started to set in a little earlier and it started to rain again and Casey started getting wigged out about flash flood danger on the final and largest rivercrossing. 
The hike out was also at least twice as muddy as the hike in. I think this was because the rain finally seeped in and stuck to the trail a little more so every single Valley that we had go through was a mud bog. 
By the time we got to the last stream crossing at the 2 mile marker Casey was ready to be done. It was perfectly fine to cross and she didn't even change her footwear, she just crossed while still in hiking boots. The last two miles seem to take the longest and to be the muddiest. I pulled out way ahead of Casey during the last 2 miles and ran down to the parking lot to get our vehicle so I could run up to meet Casey when she finished. We then went over to the sand shower next to the restrooms and washed the mud off of our legs and feet and then headed to the picnic table on the beach to eat some chips and drink a beer. It was extremely satisfying to be done with the hike and sitting in the sunshine. We checked into a new condo which was at the Kuhio shores on the southside in Poipu. The new condo was very nice and was right next to the ocean and also next to a restaurant called the Beachhouse. The lanai was about 25 feet from a perfect snorkeling spot. After we got settled into the new condo we were still exhausted from the hike so we decided to just lounge inside that night. We watched Jurassic Park and then some other crappy movie on some other crappy channel but it was perfect because we're both extremely exhausted. 
The next day we decided to go for a hike out near Waimea Canyon and overlook Kalalau beach where we had stayed earlier in the week. This was a one and a half mile hike to the viewpoint which was equally as steep and muddy as anything we saw on Kalalau trail. This was not a fun hike. But it was interesting to see the view point directly above the beach where he had previously slept. That night we had dinner at the beach house which was expensive however, it was right on the sunset point and we caught a nice sunset. 
The next day we hat we checked into our flight and headed home.
